_What is the role of public space in managing the production and consumption of resources, as well as the disposal of residues within informal areas that often exist at the margins?_

Underserved communities, such as informal settlements, often exist in places where natural resources are the scarcest, effectively setting them up for enhanced vulnerability in relationship to the formal city. Production, consumption, and disposal of goods and natural resources have great potential to be incorporated within systems to counter the prior scenario, namely within the realm of public space. Both for the present and future, ensuring access to resources in informal settlements is a complex issue for designers and planners to tackle, but it may also represent one of the most straightforward paths to begin breaching the inequality gap in cities.

Possible topics to be addressed: Access to potable water, food production/consumption, residues treatment, recycling of materials and resources, pollution, waste disposal services, local materials, sustainable energy, sanitation, etc.
