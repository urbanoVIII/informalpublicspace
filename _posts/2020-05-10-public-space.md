In this context, it is urgent for designers and planners to explore understudied topics beyond dwelling and infrastructure, such as public space, which may challenge the existing notions of informality. Interventions in communal areas are often downplayed, but they may be central in striving for equity and urban integration. 

As a multidimensional aspect, public space is highly relevant when meeting the population’s needs, creating an equitable built environment, assessing decision-making processes, and enhancing community networks. Nonetheless, its significance and relevance in informal settlements are yet to be fully explored. For this research, public space interventions in the latter context are open-ended opportunities to compensate for individual shortages in the built environment by exploring frameworks for cross-scalar action, collective agency, emotional and cognitive development, environmental awareness, and other topics related both to individual and community welfare. It is a tangible area to strive for equity and inclusion, one that is loosely defined nowadays when referring to informal settlements and that could be an entry point for planners and designers to imagine new systems of integration in the short, medium, and long-term.

This research was developed as a support material for a seminar at the GSD with the same title. During the course students had to think prospectively about the aforementioned scenarios, particularly working on innovative strategies in design and planning. They had to draw on several sources, including the [Argentinian nationally-produced database: “Registro Nacional de Barrios Populares” (RENABAP)](http://relevamiento.techo.org.ar/).

RENABAP is a survey that accounts for more than 4,000 settlements across the country, ranging from extremely dense urban “villas” to low density peripheral “asentamientos”. The challenge will be to discern patterns across both the formal and informal city to provide frameworks for action that consider the newly-produced information, particularly through the lens of understanding and decreasing vulnerability with strategies surrounding public space.

At large, the course has been organized following 6 topics, each of which has been framed and understood through the lenses of public space:

* [Community and Social Development](/2019/07/25/Community)
* [Resources and Waste](/2019/07/26/Resources)
* [Education and Innovation](/2019/07/27/Education)
* [Mobility and Accessibility](/2019/07/28/Mobility)
* [Infrastructure and Resilience](/2019/07/29/Infrastructure)
* [Implementation and Management](/2019/07/30/Implementation)
