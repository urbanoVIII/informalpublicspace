_Can public space be the backbone to conceptualize sustainable processes that include and benefit communities in both their short-term deployment and long-term maintenance?_

As previously stated, all planning and design interventions must envision systems and processes both for implementation and long-term sustainability of the actions, incorporating notions of social and environmental resilience. This includes establishing frameworks for bottom-up inclusion, incorporation of local perspectives, and contextualized solutions. Perhaps one of the most challenging topics, this area refers to how solutions are achieved and maintained, ratherly than merely what those interventions may look like. For this course, outcomes are as important as processes, framing public space as a key actor for such dynamics to unravel.

Possible topics to be addressed: sustainable implementation, collective management, collective ownership, long-term planning, participation strategies, incorporation of traditional knowledge and social practices, power dynamics, etc.
