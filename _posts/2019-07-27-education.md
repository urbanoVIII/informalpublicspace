_Can the implementation of innovative public space strategies and new technologies act as cascading examples for capacity building, community empowerment, and grassroots data generation?_

Interventions in the public realm have numerous advantages, one of which is undoubtedly to serve as examples of city making processes and catalyzers of new social dynamics. Understanding that every design and planning intervention is political by nature, there is significant room to explore how actions may serve multiple purposes, including awareness and capacity  building. Informal settlements are also places where great creativity and entrepreneurship arises, both of which are critical assets when putting forward sustainable urban models that may initiate grassroots action and rely on new technologies to advocate for development. Therefore, strategies for public space may also be framed as cutting-edge proposals both for educational, social, and technological advancement.

Possible topics to be addressed: Inclusive/grassroots mapping, Participatory Action Research, data co-creation, awareness through urban interventions, knowledge sharing, user-generated platforms, new technologies, smart cities, etc.
