_How can public space address topics beyond the physical to nurture stronger communities that may generate microeconomic networks and develop collective agency?_

Relationships are arguably a central topic when intervening in urban settings, and, as such, should be fully explored in the natural built, and social environment. This last aspect refers to an ample range of intangible ties and trends, which may substantially contribute both to individual and collective well-being. If unattended, however, it may also present significant challenges from the conception to the long-term sustainability of any proposal. It is of the utmost importance for designers and planners to engage with such complex issues, particularly as it refers to underserved communities. In other words, proposals should fully grasp relevant topics beyond the physical, helping generate stronger communities.

Possible topics to be addressed: Identity, heritage, diversity, gender equality, economic development, demographic trends, formal vs. informal economies, community empowerment, bottom-up agency, frameworks for social integration, chronic violence, community outreach, etc.
