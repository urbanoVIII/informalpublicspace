_How can public space advocate for systems that strengthen informal settlements, particularly as they face the rising and disproportionate burdens of socio-environmental threats?_

For underserved communities to flourish despite recurring socio-environmental disruptions and existing vulnerabilities, there ought to be frameworks in place to foster resilience. Either to prepare for the imminent effects of climate change or resist structural injustice, designers and planners should envision systems and spaces that promote flexibility, agency, and adaptability. Infrastructure is then how such frameworks are conceived, regardless of them being tangible or intangible. Public space may become a platform to advocate for the creation of systems that strengthen informal settlements, particularly as they face the disproportionate burdens of socio-environmental threats. 

Possible topics to be addressed: equitable resilience, environmental justice, climate change, climate adaptation and mitigation, disaster response, hydrology, social infrastructure, self-sufficiency, economic resilience, migration and displacement, etc.
