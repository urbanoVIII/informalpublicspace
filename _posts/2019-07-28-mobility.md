_What can public space do to boost community assets and spawn integrative, complementary, or alternative transportation, service provision, and connectivity patterns?_

Fringe communities, many of which may be informal settlements in large urban settings, are often effectively disconnected from their formal counterparts. This signifies a momentous burden for those who commute on a daily basis, both as an economic disadvantage and a social detriment. Time consumed in daily transportation routes, for example, may disrupt interpersonal relationships, individual welfare, and collective capacity for engagement. On the other hand, lack of access to services and opportunities within the formal city, may also disproportionately impact residents from informal settlements. Different mobility patterns may then trickle down to several other layers, significantly impacting integration and development. 

Possible topics to be addressed: connectivity, public transportation, alternative mobility means, universal accessibility, transit-oriented development, grid interconnections, healthcare, access to public services, etc.
